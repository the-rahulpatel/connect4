This is a simpe text-based and modified version of Connect4.
This is done as an assignment for CSSE1001. 
A later version with GUI will be uploaded.

About
This is an 8x8 Connect4 game, and the modifications include:
    - A player can choose to pop the first move from the bottom resulting in all the moves in the row dropping by a row. 
   

What did I learn something new?
Even though this was a basic text-based game, I was enforced to follow Google's PEP8 guide.
I learnt to:
	- write heaps of well-formated docstrings
	- create in-line comments 
	- refactor code to the fundamentals
	- develop some of the methods from scratch, such as
		- .lower()
		- .upper()
		- .pop()
